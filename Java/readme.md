## Reasons to learn Java

1. The number of job postings on LinkedIn and Indeed placed Java as the secnd most in-demand programming language.
2. Every big company uses Java, and that's because Java is fast, scalable and it can run on any machine.
3. Write once, run anywhere.
   - Because the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is responsible for executing compiled Java code can be installed on any platform (Linux aarch64, Windows x64, macOS aarch64).
4. General Purpose
   - Java powers a wide range of applications
   - As a Java developer, you can build:
      -  Web applications using Spring boot;
      -  Mobile Applications on Adroid
      -  Automate tasks using Selenium
      -  Develop cloud native applications (Quarkus)
      -  Integrate microservces (Camel)

**The opportunities that come with being a Java developer are endless.**

## Roadmap
1. Install Java on your machine [(Java 17)](https://corretto.aws/downloads/latest/amazon-corretto-17-x64-windows-jdk.msi). Java 17 has long-term support.
   - Keyword Search: amazon corretto jdk
   - To check if installation is sucessful, type command: `$ java -version`. You should see Java version of 17
2. Download VS Code with Java Extensions
    - Extension Pack for Java by Microsoft
3. Write and run your first code

## Terminal Commands
1. `javac`
   - compiles your code. Everytime you update the code, compile it.
   - Example: javac HelloJava.java
2. `java`
   - runs the compiled code.
   - Example: java HelloJava

## Common Terminal Errors
1. Running commands from an old terminal.
   - After installing java, open a new terminal
2. Misspelling the command
3. Not launching the exact folder that contains your file.

## Inlay Hints

Inlay Hints are markers that provide more information about your code.

An example of an inlay hint is this little x, but how does this x provide more information about the `println` function?
```java
   System.out.println("Hello Java");
```

In this case, it really doesn't provide any useful information.

An easy way to think about it is hey, X marks the spot where you should write the message that you want to print, but it's not really that useful.

Inlay hints will become useful once you reach the section on functions.

## 1. Getting Started
- `class`: contains all of your code.
- `main()`: entry point of your app.
- `javac <file-name>.java`: compiles your code.
- `java <file-name>`: runs the compiled code.

## 2. Variables


## Coding Pitfalls
None yet.

## Best Practices
1. The name of a class must be CamelCase.
2. You must write all of your codes in a class.
3. Use Terminal commands to compile and execute your java code. 
   - `javac` : compiles code
   - `java` : executes code
  
## Tips and Tricks
- Use the up key to run previous terminal commands.
- Use the tab key to autocomplete.
## Notes
1. Code is case-sensitive
2. The `class` name must always match the file name
3. The `class` must contain all of your code.
4. `main()` is the entry point.
5. `javac` command compiles your code.
6. `java` runs the compiled code
